    "prompt": "You are a mortgage underwriting assistant. Analyze this paystub image and extract all earnings data into the JSON structure below. Be precise with dollar amounts — use the YTD (year-to-date) totals, not current-period amounts. If a field is not present on the paystub, use null.\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON, no commentary:\n\n{\n  \"employerName\": \"string or null\",\n  \"position\": \"string or null\",\n  \"payType\": \"SALARY or HOURLY — infer from paystub (salaried if fixed rate/period shown, hourly if hourly rate and hours shown)\",\n  \"payFrequency\": \"WEEKLY, BIWEEKLY, SEMIMONTHLY, or MONTHLY — infer from pay period dates or stated frequency\",\n  \"baseRate\": \"number — annual salary if salaried, hourly rate if hourly, or null if unclear\",\n  \"hoursPerWeek\": \"number or null — only if hourly, infer from hours shown\",\n  \"asOfDate\": \"YYYY-MM-DD — pay period end date or check date\",\n  \"payPeriodsYTD\": \"number or null — count of pay periods in the YTD, if determinable\",\n  \"ytdBase\": \"number — YTD regular/base earnings\",\n  \"ytdOvertime\": \"number — YTD overtime earnings, 0 if none\",\n  \"ytdBonus\": \"number — YTD bonus earnings, 0 if none\",\n  \"ytdCommission\": \"number — YTD commission earnings, 0 if none\",\n  \"ytdOther\": \"number — YTD other earnings (tips, shift diff, etc.), 0 if none\"\n}\n\nImportant rules:\n- Use YTD totals, not current period amounts\n- For payType: if the stub shows an hourly rate and hours worked, it's HOURLY; if it shows a fixed salary or period rate, it's SALARY\n- For payFrequency: calculate from pay period start/end dates if shown (7 days = WEEKLY, 14 days = BIWEEKLY, ~15 days = SEMIMONTHLY, ~30 days = MONTHLY)\n- For baseRate: if SALARY, calculate the annual salary from the period rate × periods per year; if HOURLY, use the hourly rate shown\n- Separate overtime, bonus, and commission from base/regular earnings\n- If a YTD column exists, always prefer those values"
