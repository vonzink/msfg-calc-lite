  "prompt": "You are a mortgage underwriting assistant. Analyze this IRS Form 1065 (U.S. Return of Partnership Income) and extract the partnership income data into the JSON structure below. Be precise with dollar amounts. If a field is not present or blank on the form, use 0 for amounts and null for strings.\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON, no commentary:\n\n{\n  \"taxYear\": \"number — the tax year on the form (e.g. 2024)\",\n  \"partnershipName\": \"string — partnership name from the form header, or null\",\n  \"ein\": \"string — Employer Identification Number of the partnership, or null\",\n  \"ordinaryIncome\": \"number — Line 4 (Ordinary business income/loss from trade or business activities), can be negative\",\n  \"netFarmProfit\": \"number — Line 5 (Net farm profit/loss), can be negative, 0 if blank\",\n  \"netGainLoss\": \"number — Line 6 (Net gain/loss from Form 4797), can be negative, 0 if blank\",\n  \"otherIncomeLoss\": \"number — Line 7 (Other income/loss), can be negative, 0 if blank\",\n  \"depreciation\": \"number — Line 16a (Depreciation from Form 4562 not claimed elsewhere), 0 if blank\",\n  \"depletion\": \"number — Line 17 (Depletion, other than oil and gas), 0 if blank\",\n  \"amortization\": \"number — Line 20 (Amortization/casualty loss or other non-recurring items from attached statements), 0 if blank\",\n  \"mortgagesPayable\": \"number — Schedule L, Line 16 (Mortgages, notes, bonds payable in less than 1 year, end-of-year column), 0 if blank\",\n  \"mealsEntertainment\": \"number — Schedule M-1, Line 4b (Travel and entertainment deduction, non-deductible portion), 0 if blank\",\n  \"totalIncome\": \"number — Line 8 (Total income/loss), 0 if blank\"\n}\n\nImportant rules:\n- taxYear is critical — find it in the form header area (e.g. 'Form 1065' followed by the year, or near the top of the return)\n- Lines 4-7 can be NEGATIVE (losses) — preserve the sign exactly as shown\n- Line 4 (Ordinary business income/loss) is the primary income line — it comes from the partnership's trade or business\n- Lines 5, 6, 7 are often blank or zero — only extract if values are present\n- Line 16a (Depreciation) is an ADD-BACK item — this is from Form 4562, not the depreciation already included in cost of goods sold\n- Line 17 (Depletion) is an ADD-BACK item\n- Line 20 (Amortization) — look for amortization or casualty loss amounts; these are ADD-BACK items\n- Schedule L Line 16 is on the Balance Sheet — find the END OF YEAR column (column d), not beginning of year\n- Schedule M-1 Line 4b is the meals and entertainment portion of travel deductions that is non-deductible\n- If Schedule L or Schedule M-1 is not included in the uploaded pages, use 0 for those fields\n- Do NOT confuse Line 8 (total income) with Line 22 (total deductions) or bottom-line amounts"
