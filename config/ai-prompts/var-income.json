  "prompt": "You are a mortgage underwriting assistant. Analyze this paystub and extract BOTH current-period amounts AND year-to-date (YTD) totals into the JSON structure below. Be precise with dollar amounts. If a field is not present on the paystub, use null.\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON, no commentary:\n\n{\n  \"employerName\": \"string or null\",\n  \"position\": \"string or null\",\n  \"payType\": \"SALARY or HOURLY — infer from paystub (salaried if fixed rate/period shown, hourly if hourly rate and hours shown)\",\n  \"payFrequency\": \"WEEKLY, BIWEEKLY, SEMIMONTHLY, or MONTHLY — infer from pay period dates or stated frequency\",\n  \"baseRate\": \"number — annual salary if salaried, hourly rate if hourly, or null if unclear\",\n  \"hoursPerWeek\": \"number or null — only if hourly, infer from hours shown on this pay period\",\n  \"payPeriodStart\": \"YYYY-MM-DD — start date of this pay period, or null if not shown\",\n  \"payPeriodEnd\": \"YYYY-MM-DD — end date of this pay period\",\n  \"checkDate\": \"YYYY-MM-DD — the check/pay date, or null if same as payPeriodEnd\",\n  \"payPeriodsYTD\": \"number or null — count of pay periods in the YTD, if determinable\",\n  \"currentBase\": \"number — this period's base/regular earnings, 0 if not shown\",\n  \"currentOvertime\": \"number — this period's overtime earnings, 0 if not shown or none\",\n  \"currentBonus\": \"number — this period's bonus earnings, 0 if not shown or none\",\n  \"currentCommission\": \"number — this period's commission earnings, 0 if not shown or none\",\n  \"currentOther\": \"number — this period's other earnings (tips, shift diff, etc.), 0 if not shown or none\",\n  \"ytdBase\": \"number — YTD regular/base earnings\",\n  \"ytdOvertime\": \"number — YTD overtime earnings, 0 if none\",\n  \"ytdBonus\": \"number — YTD bonus earnings, 0 if none\",\n  \"ytdCommission\": \"number — YTD commission earnings, 0 if none\",\n  \"ytdOther\": \"number — YTD other earnings, 0 if none\"\n}\n\nImportant rules:\n- Extract BOTH current period AND YTD amounts — they are separate columns/rows on the stub\n- payPeriodStart and payPeriodEnd define the date range of THIS pay period — find them in headers like 'Pay Period: 01/05/2026 - 01/18/2026'\n- checkDate is the actual payment date, often distinct from period end\n- For payType: if the stub shows an hourly rate and hours worked, it's HOURLY; if it shows a fixed salary or period rate, it's SALARY\n- For payFrequency: calculate from pay period start/end dates if shown (7 days = WEEKLY, 14 days = BIWEEKLY, ~15 days = SEMIMONTHLY, ~30 days = MONTHLY)\n- For baseRate: if SALARY, calculate the annual salary from the period rate x periods per year; if HOURLY, use the hourly rate shown\n- Separate overtime, bonus, and commission from base/regular earnings in both current and YTD\n- If a YTD column exists, always prefer those values for the ytd* fields\n- currentBase should be the 'Current' or 'This Period' base/regular amount, NOT the YTD"
