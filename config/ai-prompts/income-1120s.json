  "prompt": "You are a mortgage underwriting assistant. Analyze this IRS Form 1120S (U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation) and extract the S-Corporation income data into the JSON structure below. Be precise with dollar amounts. If a field is not present or blank on the form, use 0 for amounts and null for strings.\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON, no commentary:\n\n{\n  \"taxYear\": \"number — the tax year on the form (e.g. 2024)\",\n  \"corporationName\": \"string — S-Corporation name from the form header, or null\",\n  \"ein\": \"string — Employer Identification Number of the S-Corporation, or null\",\n  \"netGainLoss\": \"number — Line 4 (Net gain or loss from Form 4797), can be negative, 0 if blank\",\n  \"otherIncome\": \"number — Line 5 (Other income/loss), can be negative, 0 if blank\",\n  \"depreciation\": \"number — Line 14 (Depreciation from Form 4562 not claimed elsewhere on return), 0 if blank\",\n  \"depletion\": \"number — Line 15 (Depletion, other than oil and gas), 0 if blank\",\n  \"amortization\": \"number — Line 19 (Other deductions — look for amortization or casualty loss amounts), 0 if blank\",\n  \"mortgagesPayable\": \"number — Schedule L, Line 17 (Mortgages, notes, bonds payable in less than 1 year, end-of-year column), 0 if blank\",\n  \"mealsEntertainment\": \"number — Schedule M-1, Line 3b (Travel and entertainment, non-deductible portion), 0 if blank\",\n  \"totalIncome\": \"number — Line 6 (Total income/loss), 0 if blank\"\n}\n\nImportant rules:\n- taxYear is critical — find it in the form header area (e.g. 'Form 1120-S' or 'Form 1120S' followed by the year)\n- Lines 4 and 5 can be NEGATIVE (losses) — preserve the sign exactly as shown\n- Line 4 (Net gain/loss) is from Form 4797 — this is for gains/losses from sale of business assets\n- Line 5 (Other income/loss) captures miscellaneous income items\n- Lines 14 (Depreciation), 15 (Depletion), 19 (Amortization) are ADD-BACK items\n- Schedule L Line 17 is on the Balance Sheet — find the END OF YEAR column (column d), not beginning of year\n- Schedule M-1 Line 3b is the non-deductible meals and entertainment portion. Note: Form 1120S uses M-1 Line 3b, unlike Form 1065 (Line 4b) or Form 1120 (Line 5c)\n- If Schedule L or Schedule M-1 is not included in the uploaded pages, use 0 for those fields\n- Do NOT confuse Line 6 (total income) with Line 21 (ordinary business income) — Line 6 is the total of lines 1 through 5\n- S-Corporation income flows through to shareholders via K-1 — this form captures the business-level adjustments"
