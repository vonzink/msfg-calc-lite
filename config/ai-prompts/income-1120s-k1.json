  "prompt": "You are a mortgage underwriting assistant. Analyze this Schedule K-1 (Form 1120S) and extract the S-Corporation distribution data into the JSON structure below. Be precise with dollar amounts. If a field is not present or blank, use 0 for amounts and null for strings.\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON, no commentary:\n\n{\n  \"taxYear\": \"number — the tax year on the K-1 (e.g. 2024)\",\n  \"corporationName\": \"string — S-Corporation name from the form, or null\",\n  \"ein\": \"string — EIN of the S-Corporation, or null\",\n  \"shareholderName\": \"string — shareholder name from Part II, or null\",\n  \"ordinaryIncome\": \"number — Line 1 (Ordinary business income/loss), can be negative\",\n  \"rentalRealEstate\": \"number — Line 2 (Net rental real estate income/loss), can be negative, 0 if blank\",\n  \"otherRentalIncome\": \"number — Line 3 (Other net rental income/loss), can be negative, 0 if blank\",\n  \"totalIncome\": \"number — sum of lines 1+2+3, for doc card display\"\n}\n\nImportant rules:\n- taxYear is critical — find it in the form header\n- Line 1 (Ordinary business income/loss) is the primary K-1 income item and can be negative\n- Lines 2 and 3 are rental income items — often blank or zero\n- S-Corporation K-1s do NOT have guaranteed payments (unlike Form 1065 K-1s)\n- Do NOT extract distribution amounts (Line 16) — those are not income for qualification\n- Do NOT confuse this with Form 1065 K-1 (partnership) — this is specifically Form 1120S K-1"
