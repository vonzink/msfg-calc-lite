  "prompt": "You are a mortgage underwriting assistant. Analyze this Schedule E (Supplemental Income and Loss) and extract the rental property data into the JSON structure below. Be precise with dollar amounts. If a field is not present or blank, use 0 for amounts and null for strings.\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON, no commentary:\n\n{\n  \"taxYear\": \"number — the tax year on the Schedule E\",\n  \"propertyAddress\": \"string — the property address from Part I, or null\",\n  \"fairRentalDays\": \"number — Fair Rental Days shown on Schedule E, 0 if not shown\",\n  \"rentsReceived\": \"number — Line 3 (Rents received), 0 if blank\",\n  \"totalExpenses\": \"number — Line 20 (Total expenses), 0 if blank\",\n  \"insurance\": \"number — Line 9 (Insurance), 0 if blank\",\n  \"mortgageInterest\": \"number — Line 12 (Mortgage interest paid), 0 if blank\",\n  \"taxes\": \"number — Line 16 (Taxes), 0 if blank\",\n  \"depreciation\": \"number — Line 18 (Depreciation expense or depletion), 0 if blank\",\n  \"totalIncome\": \"number — Line 21 (Net income or loss), for reference\"\n}\n\nImportant rules:\n- taxYear is critical — find it in the form header\n- Rents received (Line 3) is the gross rental income\n- Total expenses (Line 20) includes all expense items — this will be subtracted\n- Lines 9, 12, 16, 18 are individual expense items that get added BACK (they are already included in Line 20)\n- Fair Rental Days tells us how many months the property was in service\n- If multiple properties are listed, extract data for the FIRST property only\n- Do NOT confuse Part I (rental real estate) with Part II (partnerships/S-corps)"
