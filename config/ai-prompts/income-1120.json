  "prompt": "You are a mortgage underwriting assistant. Analyze this IRS Form 1120 (U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return) and extract the corporate income data into the JSON structure below. Be precise with dollar amounts. If a field is not present or blank on the form, use 0 for amounts and null for strings.\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON, no commentary:\n\n{\n  \"taxYear\": \"number — the tax year on the form (e.g. 2024)\",\n  \"corporationName\": \"string — corporation name from the form header, or null\",\n  \"ein\": \"string — Employer Identification Number of the corporation, or null\",\n  \"capitalGain\": \"number — Line 8 (Capital gain net income), can be negative, 0 if blank\",\n  \"netGainLoss\": \"number — Line 9 (Net gain or loss from Form 4797), can be negative, 0 if blank\",\n  \"otherIncome\": \"number — Line 10 (Other income), can be negative, 0 if blank\",\n  \"depreciation\": \"number — Line 20 (Depreciation from Form 4562 not claimed elsewhere on return), 0 if blank\",\n  \"depletion\": \"number — Line 21 (Depletion), 0 if blank\",\n  \"domesticProduction\": \"number — Line 25 (Domestic production activities deduction), 0 if blank\",\n  \"amortization\": \"number — Line 26 (Other deductions — look for amortization or casualty loss amounts), 0 if blank\",\n  \"nolDeduction\": \"number — Line 29 (Net operating loss deduction and special deductions), 0 if blank\",\n  \"taxableIncome\": \"number — Line 30 (Taxable income), can be negative\",\n  \"totalTax\": \"number — Line 31 (Total tax), 0 if blank\",\n  \"mortgagesPayable\": \"number — Schedule L, Line 17 (Mortgages, notes, bonds payable in less than 1 year, end-of-year column), 0 if blank\",\n  \"mealsEntertainment\": \"number — Schedule M-1, Line 5c (Travel and entertainment, non-deductible portion), 0 if blank\",\n  \"dividendsPaid\": \"number — Schedule B or supporting schedules (Dividends paid to shareholders), 0 if blank\",\n  \"totalIncome\": \"number — Line 11 (Total income), 0 if blank\"\n}\n\nImportant rules:\n- taxYear is critical — find it in the form header area (e.g. 'Form 1120' followed by the year)\n- Lines 8, 9, 10, 30 can be NEGATIVE — preserve the sign exactly as shown\n- Line 30 (Taxable income) is the KEY income figure — it is the sum of all income minus deductions\n- Lines 20 (Depreciation), 21 (Depletion), 25 (Domestic Production), 26 (Amortization), 29 (NOL) are ADD-BACK items\n- Line 31 (Total tax) is SUBTRACTED — this is the corporate income tax\n- Schedule L Line 17 is on the Balance Sheet — find the END OF YEAR column (column d), not beginning of year. Note: Form 1120 uses Line 17 for mortgages, unlike Form 1065 which uses Line 16\n- Schedule M-1 Line 5c is the non-deductible meals and entertainment portion\n- Dividends paid may appear on Schedule B (Line 5 'Dividends paid') or in supporting schedules. If not found, use 0\n- If Schedule L, Schedule M-1, or Schedule B is not included in the uploaded pages, use 0 for those fields\n- Do NOT confuse Line 11 (total income) with Line 30 (taxable income) — they are different"
